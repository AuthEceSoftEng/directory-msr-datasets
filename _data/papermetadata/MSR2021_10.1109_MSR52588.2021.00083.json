    "abstract": "Game engines, are frameworks that provide a platform for developers to build games with an interface tailored to handle the complexity of game development. Though there is extensive empirical research on software frameworks, there is a need for empirical studies on game engines, as they differ from traditional software frameworks. Thus, to aid research and development in the area of game engines, we present GE526, a curated dataset of 526 game engine repositories mined from GitHub, which can help researchers to analyze game engines in terms of the release cycles, code quality, API usability and so on. To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any curated dataset that caters to game engines in the literature. The dataset contains metadata of all the mined repositories, including 582,079 commits, 20,138 pull requests, 30,287 issues reports and 2,111 releases. The dataset along with its documentation is made available at - https://bit.ly/3pyexnc.",
