# directory-msr-datasets
This is a directory of datasets in the domain of Mining Software Repositories,
extracted from the data track of the MSR conference. Three JSON files are included
for each paper (corresponding to one dataset): one for the metadata and citations
of the paper, one for the annotations of the paper, and one for the FAIR analysis
of the dataset, computed using the F-UJI tool.

More details can be found in the paper `A Directory of Datasets for Mining Software Repositories`,
which has been submitted for publication.
