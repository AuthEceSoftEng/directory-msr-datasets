# directory-msr-datasets
This is a directory of datasets in the domain of Mining Software Repositories,
extracted from the data track of the MSR conference.

Three JSON files are included for each paper (corresponding to one dataset): one
for the metadata and citations of the paper, one for the annotations of the paper,
and one for the FAIR analysis of the dataset, computed using the F-UJI tool.

The scripts and methods used to create the directory are included in the folder
[scripts](https://github.com/AuthEceSoftEng/directory-msr-datasets/tree/main/scripts). Also, the topicmodeling folder contains information about the topic modeling
approach performed on the abstracts of the corresponding papers.

You can download the dataset from [this link](https://github.com/AuthEceSoftEng/directory-msr-datasets/raw/refs/heads/main/_data/directory.zip) or view the data online in [this link](https://authecesofteng.github.io/directory-msr-datasets/).
